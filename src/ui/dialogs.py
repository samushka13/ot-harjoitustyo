"""These are currently working:

- Creating new credentials.
- Login with existing credentials.
- Login error handling from a UX perspective.
- LoginView.
- SettingsView (draft only, buttons lead nowhere).
- Testing the LoginServices class (83 %).

A few other things are working as well, but they weren't included in this release \
because a few things need to be resolved first.

The project's codebase includes a lot of work in progress due to prototyping, \
which is why parts of the repository and some of the code it contains are quite poorly made. \
This is not optimal, of course, but it was deemed necessary \
to quickly ensure the project is actually doable within the given time frame.

What to expect next week?

- CustomQuestionsView and its logic/services will be introduced.
- Settings-related tests will be formulated.
- Most of the code will be a whole lot 'cleaner' Ã  la login-related code.
